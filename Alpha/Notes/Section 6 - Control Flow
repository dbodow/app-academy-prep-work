Section 6: Control Flow

Vocabulary:
  Block: an anonymous method (in curly braces or a do / end block)
  e.g. [1..100].{|i| puts i}

Key Concepts:
  - Iterators over closed sets are preferable to loops.
  - Blocks are closures: they can access variables from the method, but the method can't access variables from the block
Ruby keywords:
  while CONDITION / end - loop so long as CONDITION is true
  until CONDITION / end - loop so long as CONDITION is false
  break - prematurely exit a loop
  return VALUE - exit a loop returning VALUE
  next - skip ahead to a new iteration of a loop prematurely

  THING.each {BLOCK} - do the block to each element and return the original THING
  THING.each_index {BLOCK} - do the block to each element's index and return the original THING
  STRING.each_char {BLOCK} - do the block to each character in the string and return the original STRING
